            The Dream Interpreter AI is an innovative web application designed to analyze the hidden meanings behind users' dreams, providing users with personalized interpretations powered by the OPENAI API. 
            The goal of this app is to combine ancient dream analysis techniques with modern artificial intelligence, delivering accurate and insightful interpretations that help users reflect on their subconscious thoughts and emotions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Key features of the app include a user-friendly interface, a dream diary for recording and reviewing past dreams, and multilingual support (Korean) to accommodate diverse users.
             The Dream Interpreter AI also allows users to engage in multi-turn conversations, providing detailed and context-sensitive dream insights.
              Including login services and quick navigation, the app offers an intuitive and enjoyable experience for both casual and serious dreamers.
          </p>
          <p>
            This project represents a combination of my passion for AI and my curiosity about the subconscious mind, an interesting subject. The app is a practical demonstration of how AI technologies, like OpenAI's ChatGPT, can be used to explore creative and deeply personal areas of human life.
